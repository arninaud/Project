# How did IRA influence american politics?


# Abstract
In this project we look for correlations between Twitter posts by the Internet Research Agency and variations in the US citizens opinion regarding politics. 
Our goal is to analyze the Internet Research Agencyâ€™s strategy, its efficiency and highlight the impact it had over the US national elections and other political events.

# Research questions 
- What themes, hashtags, politicians are mostly addressed?
- How did the IRA influence US politics? How efficient was it regarding the popularity of politicians?
- Has the writing style changed over time? Is it very different depending on the autor? 
- What strategies did IRA implement? 
- What sentiment is dominant in those tweets, is it constant over time?
- What strategy does the IRA adopt to mock real users?

# Dataset
We use data from FiveThirtyEight containing nearly 3 million tweets sent from Twitter, all connected to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian "troll factory" and a defendant in an indictment filed by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The tweets in this database were sent between February 2012 and May 2018, with the vast majority posted from 2015 through 2017.

To download the data you have 2 possibilities: 
- kaggle datasets download -d fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets from command line
- https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets and download it by hand.

Once this is done you only need to put the data at the root of the clone of this repository in a folder named: russian-troll-tweets and then you can launch the code in a jupyter notebook.

# Actual state
Milestone 3 is done.

Next step: Final presentation and poster
